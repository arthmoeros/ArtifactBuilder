Hi!, Arturo here, I'm starting a dev blog about the developing of Artifacter. First I would like to explain just what the heck is *Artifacter*.

Artifacter started as a Java Servlet application I made by myself to save time developing OSB proxy services, it evolved until it became a tool for generating any kind of artifacts, nicely packaged and ready for use as a basis for developing.
This application uses three key components to create an "Artifact Generation", which are: Form, Generator and Configuration, when I get some free time I could explain in depth within another post, but for now I will explain about this one *Artifacter*.

This *Artifacter* that I'm developing now it is written in TypeScript, using Angular for the front-end, and node.js as back-end (I'm planning to use MongoDB and even throw Apache Kafka into the mix), you may think that using these may be overkill for a simple file generating application, but the motivation to do this rewrite, it is because I'm falling behind in regards to the growing frameworks being used today, so this is a means to "update" myself.
