### UI for Artifacter

#### What's this? - Intro
This a Web User Interface that is dynamically generated by using Artifacter's Form Configuration info, it connects to the API and provides HTML forms to submit artifact generation requests to Artifacter. It supports all of Artifacter features.

#### How does this works? - Internal works
This is an Angular App, it uses two main components: form-renderer and input-renderer, the latter being a recursive one, where all the HTML input generation occurs, it can handle Artifacter's string, number, date, choice and array types. On every submit, it invokes Artifacter generation request service and downloads the zip file containing the generated artifacts.

#### How does it run? - Getting started
You can git clone this same repo and start it just like this
```bash
git clone https://github.com/arthmoeros/artifacter-ui/
npm install
npm start
```

Although you must to provide a valid Artifacter host, this is done in the environment.ts file, by default is 'http://localhost:8080'

#### Can I try this? - Live Demo
Not yet, the old version is available as a Heroku App (please be mindful of your use, it is a free account), go here -> https://artifacter.herokuapp.com/

#### How does it stands? - Status
This module was made using Angular's quickstart as a basis, so it has a bit of clutter to clean yet, but it does work fine as is. The front is responsive though.

#### What's next? - Planned features for a future release
Not much, mostly a refactor of the ugly form validation method that is in place, because the form model is not shared between form-renderer and input-renderer, besides that nothing else, feel free to suggest any new feature, with a sample use case.
